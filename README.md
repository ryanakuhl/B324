Bootstrap Three To Four

A lightweight find-and-replace dictionary to ease converting Bootstrap 3 classes to Boostrap 4.

Just copy your HTML, run the script, then paste your new html that no longer has empty tags and is pretty printed.
A great component to plug into a Selenium iteration to assit in converting a website. 

Contributions are welcomed.
